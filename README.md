# CS-320

  I ensure that my code, program, or software are functional and secure by utilizing testing techniques such as unit testing.  With the use of unit testing I can check all portions of the program for errors or other functionality issues.  I interpret user needs and incorrporate them into a program by analyzing established requirements and planning out the implementation of each feature.  I approach designing software with multiple planning techniques, such as making a UML diagram to create a clear plan for the software to be developed.
